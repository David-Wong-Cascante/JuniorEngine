# JuniorEngine
## Purpose
I belief that I don't appreciate things until I do things myself. I wanted to appreciate how games are made, therefore I decided to create my own game engine and
hopefully finish it.
## Content
This engine is going to be small by nature. There is no way I am going to making netcode, at least for the moment. However, I want to create anything that would be
essential to a game engine. The topic I am most interested in working on is graphics. As a result, the graphics engine is pretty complex but anything else will
be simple.
Things I am planning to create in the future:
- [X] An event system
- [ ] Simple homemade physics engine
- [ ] Sound engine
- [ ] Minimliastic level editor
as time moves on, I will be adding more and more features to the engine.
## Development Branches
Master Branch - All features are at a usable state, they may need some more progress but they are usable
Developmental Branch - Some features are being put into the engine which have not been tested
## Known Bugs
- Not really a bug, but there is no way to switch levels after the main one is loaded
